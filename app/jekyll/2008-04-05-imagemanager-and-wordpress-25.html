<p>ImageManager supporting WordPress 2.5 will hopefully be ready by the end of next week.</p>
<p><strong>Update 8.4.2008: </strong>ImageManager 2.5 is "working" in WordPress 2.5, but you'll have to give me a couple of days to get rid of bugs (mainly javascript errors). I've been <a href="https://www.getfirebug.com/">firebugging</a> all night, now I'm off to my day job. I will continue debugging ImageManager later today (i.e. tonight .. this is a midnight hack) .</p>
<p><strong>Update 9.4.2008: </strong>All javascript errors are found  (according to Firebug) and fixed.  Tomorrow night  I will  do  testing.</p>
<p><strong>10.4.2008</strong>: ImageManager 2.5.0 is released, you'll find it at <a href="https://soderlind.no/ImageManager">https://soderlind.no/ImageManager</a></p>
<p><strong>16.4.2008</strong>: ImageManager 2.5.2 supporting WPMU 1.3.3 is almost done (should also support WPMU 1.5 when it's released). I will also test it against WordPress 2.3.x prior to release. The plan is to release it by the end of this week</p>
<p><strong>17.4.2008</strong>: I just released v2.5.2 which supports WP 2.5, WP 2.3.3 and WPMU 1.3.3</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is a maintenance release (i.e. no new features are added). It's only tested with  WordPress 2.5 , WordPress 2.3.3 and WPMU 1.3.3, and in IE 7 / Firefox 2.x</p>
