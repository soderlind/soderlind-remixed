<p>"I'm totally fed up with the RSS vs. ATOM debate, so I've decided to strike out on my own.<br />Rather than putting all my hopes in a community effort to arrive at a standard syndication format that works better than ATOM or RSS, I'm creating a brand new format entirely on my own (you're welcome), and I think you're going to like it."
