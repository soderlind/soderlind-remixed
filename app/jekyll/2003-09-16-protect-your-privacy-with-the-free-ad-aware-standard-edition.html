<p>"Most people are familiar with freeware, shareware, cookies, media players, interactive content, and file sharing. What they may not realize is that some of the aforementioned may contain code or components that allow the developers of these applications and tools to actually collect and disseminate information about those using them."</p>
<p>I personally recommend it, I was "shocked" when I first ran Ad-aware, it was a lot that my anti virus tool didn't detect that Ad-aware did.
