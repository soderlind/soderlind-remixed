<p>Scott Mitchell / 4GuysFromRolla.com: "This article, the fourth in the series, begins with a quick examination of AVL trees and red-black trees, which are two different self-balancing, binary search tree data structures. The remainder of the article examines the skip list data structure, an ingenious data structure that turns a linked list into a data structure that offers the same running time as the more complex self-balancing tree data structures. (31 printed pages)"
