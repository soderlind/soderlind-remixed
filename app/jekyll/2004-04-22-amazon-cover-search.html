<p>The Amazon Cover Search (ACS) will search in the product catalog of Amazon Germany, Amazon UK, Amazon US and Amazon Japan for CDs, DVDs, videos and books. The results, which includes covers, tracklists and reviews can be saved to your harddisk for further editing. The saved data is useable to organize your CDs, DVDs, videos and books in other programs and databases.
