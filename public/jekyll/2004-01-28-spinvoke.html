<p> "SP/Invoke generates code to allow C#, VB or JScript.NET programmers to invoke SQL Server stored procedures as if they were static methods on CLR classes. It was objectnation's submission to Chris Sell's 'Spend a Day With .NET' contest where it won the 'Best Use of SQL' prize (click <a href="https://www.sellsbrothers.com/fun/DayWithDotNet/">here</a> for information about the winners). The version featured here includes numerous improvements which were made subsequent to the original submission."
