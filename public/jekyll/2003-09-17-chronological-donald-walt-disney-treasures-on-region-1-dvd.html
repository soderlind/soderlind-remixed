<p>"It was 1934 when the irascible Donald Duck came to life in a teeny bit of a part in The Wise Little Hen and proceeded to steal the show. From that point on nobody could hold him back, and the much loved cranky character went on to be the most prolific of Walt's 'fabulous five.' Now for the first time, you can enjoy the Donald in all of his solo starring shorts from 'Donald And Pluto' in 1936 to 'Chef Donald' in 1941. This volume also includes a loving tribute to the man who achieved immortality by inventing the voice of Donald Duck -- and performing as his alter ego for 50 years -- Clarence 'Ducky' Nash. Featuring exclusive introductions by film historian Leonard Maltin, this is a timeless collection from generations past for generations to come."</p>
<p>This is a must-have !
