<p> "When speed counts, the keyboard is still king. Almost all the actions and commands you can perform with a mouse you can perform faster using combinations of keys on your keyboard. These simple keyboard shortcuts can get you where you want to go faster than several clicks of a mouse. You'll work faster on spreadsheets and similar documents, too, because you won't lose your place switching back and forth between mouse and keys."<br />more at: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/using/tips/personalize/keyboardsc.asp">https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/home/using/tips/personalize/keyboardsc.asp</a>
