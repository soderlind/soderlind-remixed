<p>..i.e. lack of documentation.</p>
<p>Today I installed <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/servers/hyper-v-server/">Microsoft Hyper-V</a> on <a href="https://www.netconnect.com/">our</a> new test server, a HP DL380 with 32GB memory and plenty of disk (800GB in RAID 5 and a hot spare). The install was quick and easy, but getting it on net was not. With a new router/firewall, configuration new to us, we thought it was causing all the "pain" and struggled for hours until we decided enough is enough, let's continue tomorrow.</p>
<p>Luckily, surfing the net, I stumbled upon the solution to our grieve. Microsoft Hyper-V has its firewall enabled per default (yes, I know, I should have known it was). To managed the hidden features of Microsoft Hyper-V, you have to use <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754516.aspx">netsh</a> from the command prompt, and to disable the firewall (remember I said, we're using an external firewall, and hence we don't need the on-board firewall) all you have to do is:</p>
<pre >netsh firewall set opmode disable</pre>
<p>Hopefully this information will help you when you install your Hyper-V, and hopefully Microsoft will add this to their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/servers/hyper-v-server/faq.mspx">FAQ</a>.</p>
